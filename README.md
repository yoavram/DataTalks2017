## Abstract

I will introduce the Python programming language and demonstrate how Scientific Python can be used to study evolutionary theory using mathematical and computational models. We'll see how to run fast evolutionary simulations with NumPy and Cython, analyze and visualize simulation results with Pandas and Seaborn, and find solutions to evolutionary models using SciPy. This talk is a wonderful opportunity to learn about Scientific Python through actual research-based examples, as well as an occasion to to discover how theoretical evolutionary biologists approach their research.
